# Should we install Fiori Apps Usage Report on SAP Solution Manager?

SAP Solution Manager is a very good choice when it comes to using Fiori App Usage Report and Fiori Tracker suite tools when your main landscape can get temporarily offline (upgrades and other maintenance activities). The only reason we do not encourage our users to use SAP Solution Manager is that most of the installations are on NetWeaver below 7.52 while Fiori Tracker Suite component need at least NetWeaver 7.52. If your SAP Solution Manager is on 7.52 then it is a perfect place for installation.
